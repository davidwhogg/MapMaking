## Philosophy
We love Bayesian thinking.
However, engineering projects might need to produce *maps*.
For our purposes, a map is a point estimate of a scalar (or vector or tensor) field on the sky.

Point estimates generated by convex optimization are to be preferred to other kinds of estimates:
The convexity means that there are no initialization dependences.
The optimization means that there is an explicit objective function,
which makes explicit the assumptions underlying the method.

## Projects
- Thermal S-Z maps from *Planck*.
- Foreground maps from *Planck*.
