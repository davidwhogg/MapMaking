\paragraph{abstract}
% context
How to combine multi-wavelength maps of the microwave sky to generate
maps of the cosmic microwave background primary anisotropies, the
thermal and kinetic Sunyaev--Zeldovich effects, point sources, and
Milky Way foregrounds?
Each of these has different dependences on wavelength, and different
spatial structure.
But because we have only one sky, they can't be separated cleanly at
high confidence.
% aims
Nonetheless, for many purposes, we want to be able to make point
estimates of these maps from our very good all-sky data.
Here we consider map-making algorithms based on convex optimization.
% methods
We construct a family of objective functions based on L1 and L2 norms
of maps and residuals such that optimization is convex and the optimal
maps are maps of cosmological quantities of interest.
Being convex, optimization is reliable and straightforward.
% results
We find YYY.
