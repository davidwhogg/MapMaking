\paragraph{abstract}
% context
How to combine multi-wavelength maps of the microwave sky to generate
maps of the cosmic microwave background primary anisotropies, the
thermal and kinetic Sunyaev--Zeldovich effects, point sources, and
Milky Way foregrounds?
Each of these has different dependences on wavelength, and different
spatial structure.
But because we have only one sky, they can't be separated cleanly at
high confidence.
% aims
Nonetheless, for many purposes, we want to be able to make point
estimates of these maps from our very good all-sky data.
Here we consider map-making algorithms based on convex optimization.
% methods
We construct a family of objective functions based on L1 and L2 norms
of maps and residuals such that optimization is convex and the optimal
maps are maps of cosmological quantities of interest.
Being convex, optimization is reliable and straightforward.
% results
We find YYY.

\section{Method}

The model is
\begin{eqnarray}
  y_{np} &=& \sum_{p'} B_{npp'}\,\left[
      \sum_{\ell m} R_{p'\ell m}\,t_{\ell m}
    + \sum_{k} A_{nk}\,x_{kp'}\right] + \sigma_{np}\,\epsilon_{np} \quad ,
\end{eqnarray}
where the $y_{np}$ are the data on wavelength $n$ in data pixel $p$,
$B_{npp'}$ is the beam at frequency $n$, relating the response of data
pixel $p$ to model-plane (map-plane) pixel $p'$, $R_{p'\ell m}$ is the
spherical-harmonic transform from the $\ell m$ basis to the $p'$
basis, $t_{\ell m}$ is the temperature map in the $\ell m$ basis,
$A_{nk}$ is the design matrix containing every possible foreground or
secondary anisotropy's relative contribution at wavelength $n$, the
$x_{kp'}$ are the secondary and foreground maps, the $\sigma_{np}$ are
the individual-pixel noise root-variances, and the $\epsilon_{np}$ are
the normalized residuals (or pixel-noise contributions).

The objective function is
\begin{eqnarray}
  Q &=&
    \sum_{\ell m} C_{\ell m}^{-1}\,|t_{\ell m}|^2
  + \sum_{k} \Lambda_k\,\sum_{p'} |x_{kp'}|
  + \sum_{np} |\epsilon_{np}|^2 \quad ,
\end{eqnarray}
where the first term penalizes the temperature maps according to the
expected variances $C_{\ell m}$ from the cosmological model, the
second term asks each of the $K$ foreground and secondary maps $k$ to
be sparse, and the third term is (effectively) the likelihood
function.
This objective function is convex, so a gradient descent in the space
of the $t_{\ell m}$, the $x_{kp'}$, and the $\epsilon_{np}$ will
obtain a unique set of maps.
